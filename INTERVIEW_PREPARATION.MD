## Docker

## Kubernetes
 - Current version is v1.18
 - Previous versions are v1.17..14
 - Kubernetes is portable, extensible, open source plateform for managing containerised workload & services, that facilitate both declarative configuration and automation. 
 - Google Open-sourced the kubernetes project in 2014.
 - Traditional deployment era: Early on, organizations ran applications on physical servers. There was no way to define resource boundaries for applications in a physical server, and this caused resource allocation issues. 
 - Virtualized deployment era: As a solution, virtualization was introduced. It allows you to run multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) on a single physical server's CPU. Virtualization allows applications to be isolated between VMs and provides a level of security as the information of one application cannot be freely accessed by another application.
Virtualization allows better utilization of resources in a physical server and allows better scalability because an application can be added or updated easily, reduces hardware costs, and much more.
 - Containers are a good way to bundle and run your applications. In a production environment, you need to manage the containers that run the applications and ensure that there is no downtime.
 #### Kubernetes provides you 
 - Service discovery and load balancing
 -- Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
