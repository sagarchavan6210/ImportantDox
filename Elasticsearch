Elasticsearch:

Elasticsearch is a highly scalable open-source full-text search and analytics engine. It allows you to store, search, and analyze big volumes of data quickly and in near real time.

Cluster:A cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together holds your entire data and provides federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.

Node:A node is a single server that is part of your cluster, stores your data, and participates in the cluster’s indexing and search capabilities.

Index: An index is a collection of documents that have somewhat similar characteristics. 

Type: is a logical partition of index

Document:  A document is a basic unit of information that can be indexed.

Shards:  An index can potentially store a large amount of data that can exceed the hardware limits of a single node.To solve this problem, Elasticsearch provides the ability to subdivide your index into multiple pieces called shards. 
**Sharding is important for two primary reasons:
It allows you to horizontally split/scale your content volume
It allows you to distribute and parallelize operations across shards (potentially on multiple nodes) thus increasing performance/throughput

Replica:
Elasticsearch allows you to make one or more copies of your index’s shards called replica. 
**Replication is important for two primary reasons:
It provides high availability in case a shard/node fails.
It allows you to scale out your search volume/throughput since searches can be executed on all replicas in parallel.
